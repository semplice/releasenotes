Semplice for Workstations 2015.1-preview "Jethro Tull"
======================================================

It's our pleasure to announce the first preview release of Semplice for Workstations 2015,
codenamed "Jethro Tull".

This release is based on Debian 8.1, plus the updates available at the moment of build (2015-08-03).
The iso images ship with Linux kernel 4.1.2.

Known issues
------------

Please keep in mind the following notes about this release:

* It's currently not possible to graphically switch the base update channel
  to Semplice 7 (current)'s one.  
  This is due to some ongoing issues with the upgrade to Debian sid.  
    
  A later upgrade will restore the functionality. In the meantime, should
  you wish to switch to the current channel, you can do so via the command-line,
  using the `channels` tool.

* The installer blocks at the partitioning stage if there are table-less
  disks.  
  This prevents installation in fresh virtual drives.  
    
  *This has been resolved in linstaller 7.0.4. Use the built-in update function
  to update the installer*
